When I do big data computing in a cluster, I need to copy files in a loop from a server to other servers. On the other hand, the existed shell comands are not perfectlly satisfied with my demand.

I have no configurated instances on Cloud Server, like AWS, Alibaba, etc., as my student discount was expired. Fortunatly, I have a new computer which is good enough to run multiple virtual machines.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
