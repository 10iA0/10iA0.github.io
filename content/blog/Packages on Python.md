# Python os
## Python os.walk()

I cite the pharagraph below form this link:
[https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/os-walk-python/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/os-walk-python/).

>**How to traverse file system in Python?**
>
>Suppose we have given below file structure in our system and we want to traverse all itâ€™s branches completely from top to bottom ?
>
>**How does os.walk() work in python?**
>
>OS.walk() generate the file names in a directory tree by walking the tree either top-down or bottom-up. For each directory in the tree rooted at directory top (including top itself), it yields a 3-tuple (dirpath, dirnames, filenames).

>- root : Prints out directories only from what you specified.
>- dirs : Prints out sub-directories from root.
>- files : Prints out all files from root and directories.
